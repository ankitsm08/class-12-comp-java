# Question:

A Composite Magic number is a positive integer which is composite as well as a magic number.

**Composite number:** A composite number is a number which has more than two factors.

### For example:  
Factors of 10 are: $1, 2, 5, 10$

**Magic number:** A Magic number is a number in which the eventual sum of the digit is equal to 1.

### For example:  
$28 = 2 + 8 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1$

Accept two positive integers 'm' and 'n', where $m < n$. Find the number of composite magic integers that are in the range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them along with frequency.

## Display the output in the format specified below:

### Example 1

**Input:**  
m=10, n=100

**Output:**  
The composite magic numbers are 10, 28, 46, 55, 64, 82, 91, 100  
Frequency of composite magic numbers: 8

### Example 2

**Input:**  
m=120, n=90

**Output:**  
Invalid input
