# ISC 12th Class Computer Science Project

Java Project that had been assigned to me during my Class 12 ISC Preparation.

It was required to be digitally made, so I created this repo with all the files.

I would like to thank my teacher, parents and friends for every help provided for the completion of this awesome project.

## Requirements
### programs
`java`

### doc file
`ms word`

font files: `CMU Family`, `Jetbrains Mono`, `Fira Code`
