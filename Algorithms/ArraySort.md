1. Input Matrix Dimensions:
   - Read values for m (number of rows) and n (number of columns).
   - Validate that m and n are both greater than 2 and less than 10. If not, display "MATRIX SIZE OUT OF RANGE" and terminate.

2. Input Matrix Elements:
   - Create a 2D array a[m][n] to store the matrix elements.
   - Use a nested loop to allow the user to input values for each element in the matrix.

3. Display Original Matrix:
   - Traverse through the matrix and print its original form, row by row.

4. Sort Each Row:
   - Implement bubble sort on each row of the matrix. For each row, compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are out of order. Repeat this process until all elements in the row are sorted.

5. Display Sorted Matrix:
   - After sorting, traverse the matrix again and print each row.
