1. Initialize Variables:
   - Create a class DateConvert with instance variables: n (day number), d (day of the month), m (month), and y (year).

2. Input:
   - In the accept() method, take user input for the day number (n) and the year (y), also validating them.

3. Determine Leap Year:
   - In the day_to_date() method, check if the given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs if: 
     - The year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless divisible by 400.

4. Set Month Boundaries:
   - Define arrays for the number of days in each month for leap and non-leap years.
   - Use a loop to find the corresponding month by subtracting the number of days in each month from n until n becomes less than the number of days in that month.

5. Determine Date:
   - The remaining value of n will be the date, and the month will be the index of the loop.

6. Display Result:
   - In the display() method, map the month number to its name and print the date, month name, and year.
