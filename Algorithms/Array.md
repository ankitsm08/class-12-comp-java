1. Input and Validation:
   - Accept the size N for the matrix and array. Ensure N is between 3 and 9 (both inclusive). If out of range, display an error message and exit.

2. Array Input:
   - Accept N positive integers into the single-dimensional array a[].

3. Sorting:
   - Sort the array a[] in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

4. Matrix Filling:
   - Fill the matrix b[][] such that:
     - First row b[0] holds the sorted array a[].
     - Each subsequent row has the same elements as the previous row but shifted cyclically leftward.

5. Display:
   - Display the sorted array.
   - Display the matrix.
